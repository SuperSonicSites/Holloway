# FAQ

question1: "Does it hurt?"
answer1: "We apply a numbing agent to the area so that you are as comfortable as possible during the process."

question2: "What is the healing time?"
answer2: "It depends on the treatment, but the initial healing process can take about 5-14 days."

question3: "Can I get a tattoo if I'm pregnant?"
answer3: "We do not recommend having some form of cosmetic tattooing during pregnancy, and as a precaution, we do not accept clients who are pregnant, for possible risks of numbness and stress."

question4: "Should I do this before or after a trip to a hot destination?"
answer4: "We do not recommend cosmetic tattooing before going somewhere where you will be much exposed to the sun. If you show up with sunburn, your appointment will be cancelled and your deposit will not be given to you."

question5: "How does a first session go?"
answer5: "Jessica Holloway, cosmetic tattoo artist, will take the time to chat with you to understand your 'goals', will ask you a variety of questions to get to know you better and better know your lifestyle. She will then explain the process, what to expect, the steps to take for the care of new cosmetic tattoos and answer your questions or concerns."
